- Implements a **single-layer neural network**.
- Trained using **gradient descent** and **backpropagation**.
- Classifies instances from multiple datasets.
- Evaluates performance using various metrics.

### Multi-Layer Neural Network
- Implements a **multi-layer neural network** for classification.
- Includes **forward pass, backward pass, and weight updates**.
- Analyzes trade-offs between **accuracy, hidden units, and overfitting**.

### Ensemble Learning: AdaBoost
- Implements the **AdaBoost algorithm**.
- Classifies **faces using Haar features**.
