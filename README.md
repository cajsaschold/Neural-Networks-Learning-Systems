# TBMI26
This repository contains assignments and implementations from the course "Neural Networks and Learning Systems" at Link√∂ping University (LiU). The projects explore various machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques, including k-Nearest Neighbors, neural networks, ensemble learning, and Q-learning.

## k-Nearest Neighbour
This notebook implements the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm and applies it to four datasets. The model is evaluated using various metrics, and the optimal k-value is determined through cross-validation.

## Single-Layer Neural Network
A single-layer neural network trained using gradient descent and backpropagation. The network is used for classification across multiple datasets, and its performance is analyzed using different evaluation metrics.

## Multi-Layer Neural Network
This notebook implements a multi-layer neural network that classifies instances from four datasets. It includes forward pass, backward pass, and weight updates. The analysis explores the trade-off between network depth, accuracy, and overfitting.

## Ensemble Learning: AdaBoost
An implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm for face classification using Haar features. The notebook explores the boosting technique and evaluates its impact on classification performance.

## Reinforcement Learning: Q-Learning
A Q-learning implementation applied to various GridWorld environments. The notebook explores hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate, to optimize reinforcement learning performance.
