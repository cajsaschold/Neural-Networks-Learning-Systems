The assignments from the course "Neural Networks and Learning Systems" at LiU

## k-Nearest Neighbour
This Jupyter Notebook contains an implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm applied to four different datasets. The algorithm's performance on the datasets is evaluated using various metrics, and the optimal value for k is chosen through cross-validation.

## Single Layer Neural Network
This Jupyter Notebook contains an implementation of a single layer neural network, using gradient descent and backpropagation to find the optimal weights and biases. The network is used for classifying the instances of four different datasets. The Netwok's preformance on the different datasets is then evaluated by several metrics.
